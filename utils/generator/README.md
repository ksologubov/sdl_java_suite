# Proxy Library RPC Generator

## Overview

This script provides the possibility to auto-generate Java code based on a given SDL MOBILE_API XML specification.

## Requirements

The script requires Python 3.5 pre-installed in the system. This is the minimal Python 3 version that has not reached the end-of-life (https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches).

Some required libraries are described in `requirements.txt` and should be pre-installed by the command:
```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please also make sure before usage the 'utils/generator/rpc_spec' Git submodule is successfully initialized, because the script uses the XML parser provided there.

## Usage
```shell script
usage: generator.py [-h] [-v] [-xml SOURCE_XML] [-xsd SOURCE_XSD]
                    [-d OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [-t [TEMPLATES_DIRECTORY]]
                    [-r REGEX_PATTERN] [--verbose] [-e] [-s] [-m] [-y] [-n]

Proxy Library RPC Generator

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         print the version and exit
  -xml SOURCE_XML, --source-xml SOURCE_XML, --input-file SOURCE_XML
                        should point to MOBILE_API.xml
  -xsd SOURCE_XSD, --source-xsd SOURCE_XSD
  -d OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                        define the place where the generated output should be
                        placed
  -t [TEMPLATES_DIRECTORY], --templates-directory [TEMPLATES_DIRECTORY]
                        path to directory with templates
  -r REGEX_PATTERN, --regex-pattern REGEX_PATTERN
                        only elements matched with defined regex pattern will
                        be parsed and generated
  --verbose             display additional details like logs etc
  -e, --enums           only specified elements will be generated, if present
  -s, --structs         only specified elements will be generated, if present
  -m, -f, --functions   only specified elements will be generated, if present
  -y, --overwrite       force overwriting of existing files in output
                        directory, ignore confirmation message
  -n, --skip            skip overwriting of existing files in output
                        directory, ignore confirmation message
```

# Java Transformation rules

## Overview
These are the general transformation rules for RPC classes of SDL Java Suite Library. The description of base classes, already included in the library, is not provided here, for details please view the source code. 

The JavaDoc is used for inline documentation of generated code. All non-XML values should follow Contributing to SDL Projects [CONTRIBUTING.md](ttps://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_android/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

These rules based on the current `develop` branch state (commit:`e4ef8d455dba485619ea446bf445f113263241ff`) of [`smartdevicelink/sdl_java_suite`](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_java_suite) repository.

## `<enum>`
Each Enum class should be stored as a single script file in the folder named `enums` and the name of the script file should be equal to the value from the `"name"` attribute of `<enum>` followed by the extension `.java`.

Example:
```shell script
enums/ImageType.java
```
